"""
Dual-network isolation verifier for exchanger-class parts (heat exchangers,
manifolds, anything carrying two fluids). Watertightness is not the interesting
invariant for these — NETWORK TOPOLOGY is: each fluid domain must connect its
own inlet/outlet pair, with zero cross-leak paths.

`check_networks(mesh, ports)` voxelizes the part, labels the void space with
26-connectivity, and maps each declared port to the void component it lands
in. Port naming convention: ports of the same circuit share the prefix before
the first underscore ("a_in" / "a_out" are one pair).

Resolution honesty: isolation verified at voxel pitch p means "no leak path
wider than ~p" — a pinhole narrower than a voxel can slip through the
occupancy grid. The report always carries the pitch used; surface UI copy
should state exactly that bound, not "leak-free".
