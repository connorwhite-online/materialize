"""
SDF toolkit for the text-to-CAD "functional skeleton + organic skin" path
(Tier 1). The model defines EXACT functional anchors (bosses, holes, faces) and
smooth-unions an ORGANIC connecting body, then `to_mesh` marching-cubes it to a
watertight trimesh. This is how you get organic, load-path-looking forms that
still hold real tolerances — beauty draped over fixed function, not a pile of
joined primitives (and not an unconstrained generative blob).

All primitives are vectorized: they take P, an (N,3) array of sample points, and
return an (N,) signed distance (negative inside the solid). Compose with smin
(smooth union), subtract (cut), and smax (smooth intersect).

v2 adds TPMS lattice fields (gyroid / schwarz_p / diamond), region masking,
shell/offset field operators, point-warp transforms, and `from_mesh` — the
B-rep bridge that turns any trimesh (e.g. a tessellated build123d flange) into
an SDF you can smin into an implicit body.

v3 adds the dual-fluid vocabulary: `tpms_dist` (signed mm distance to a TPMS
midsurface), `seal_ramp` (0..1 face-seal weights), and `dual_sheet` (the
two-fluid separator with per-point channel capping). `exchanger.py` composes
them into a complete manifolded heat-exchanger block.

Importable by sidecar-exec'd model code: `from sdf_kit import *`.
